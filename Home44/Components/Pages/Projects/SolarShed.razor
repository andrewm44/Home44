<PageTitle>A Solar Powered Shed</PageTitle>

<hr />
Solar heating and lighting

heating - a up to 100W constant to keep the chill off

    a booster when the shed is in use e.g. fan heater

thermostats and timers

LED lights
also USB power sockets

use of old batteries
<hr/>
NOTE for heating, realistically, the requirement can only be to run something less than 100W, just to keep the chill off
it would be supplemented by something like a paraffin heater

some sums

so.... say 100W for 24 hours = 2400Wh
